# Comparing-MPPT-Techniques
MPPT is used to get the most electricity possible from the solar panels. In this research, to reduce the energy loss supplied by the PV module and to increase energy efficiency, we will examine and contrast the performances of MPPT approaches control systems composed of a PV solar system under various irradiation situations.
